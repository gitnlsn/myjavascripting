You assigned a value to quux, even though foo() doesn't have access to the
quux inside zip().

# Solution

The scope chain of the solution looks like this:

    (global)
      quux
        â†‘
        |
      foo()
     var bar
        â†‘
        |
       zip()
     var quux

Following the arrows, we can see that the quux assigned inside foo() has
become globally scoped. This is a different quux from the one inside zip(),
which now shadows the globally scoped quux.
